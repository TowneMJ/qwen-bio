DNA helicase unwinds DNA, DNA ligase joins DNA fragments, topoisomerase relieves supercoiling tension, SSB proteins stabilize single-stranded DNA, exonuclease removes nucleotides, DNA gyrase is a type of topoisomerase, and ribonuclease H degrades RNA in RNA-DNA hybrids.

To answer this, I need to recall the roles of different enzymes in prokaryotic DNA replication. In prokaryotes like E. coli, there are three main DNA polymerases: Pol I, Pol II, and Pol III. DNA polymerase III is the main replicative enzyme that synthesizes the majority of both the leading and lagging strands. It has high processivity, meaning it can add many nucleotides before dissociating. DNA polymerase I plays a specialized role in removing RNA primers and filling in the gaps, but it synthesizes only small segments. DNA polymerase II is involved in DNA repair rather than normal replication. The other options (primase, helicase, ligase, topoisomerase, SSB proteins) are all important for replication but do not synthesize DNA strands.

First, I need to recall that telomeres are protective DNA-protein structures at chromosome ends consisting of repetitive sequences (TTAGGG in humans). During DNA replication, the end-replication problem occurs because DNA polymerase cannot fully replicate the 5' ends of linear chromosomes. Telomerase can solve this problem by adding telomeric repeats, but most somatic cells have little to no telomerase activity after development. Without telomerase, telomeres cannot be replenished and thus shorten with each round of cell division. This progressive shortening eventually leads to critically short telomeres, which trigger cellular senescence pathways as a protective mechanism against genomic instability. Looking at the options: A is wrong because telomeres shorten, not lengthen, without telomerase. B is incorrect because telomeres do change length. D-J describe various impossible or irrelevant processes. C correctly describes the well-established process of progressive telomere shortening leading to senescence in the absence of telomerase.", "correct_answer": "C", "confidence": "high", "topic": "molecular_genetics", "subtopic": "Telomeres and telomerase", "category": "molecular_genetics"}
{"question": "Which of the following best describes the primary function of telomerase in eukaryotic cells?", "options": {"A": "To repair double-strand breaks in DNA throughout the chromosome", "B": "To add repetitive DNA sequences to the 3' ends of chromosomes", "C": "To remove damaged telomeric DNA from chromosome ends", "D": "To facilitate crossing over during meiosis", "E": "To synthesize the leading strand during DNA replication", "F": "To unwind DNA helices at replication origins", "G": "To proofread newly synthesized DNA for errors", "H": "To package DNA into nucleosomes", "I": "To transcribe telomeric DNA into mRNA", "J": "To methylate cytosine residues in telomeric sequences"}, "concept_tested": "Understanding the primary enzymatic function of telomerase in chromosome maintenance.", "reasoning": "The question asks about the primary function of telomerase. I need to recall what telomerase does and how it works. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein enzyme that addresses the end-replication problem in linear chromosomes. During DNA replication, the lagging strand cannot be completely synthesized at the 5' end due to the removal of RNA primers, leading to progressive shortening of chromosomes. Telomerase solves this by adding repetitive telomeric DNA sequences (like TTAGGG in humans) to the 3' ends of chromosomes. It uses its own RNA component as a template to synthesize these repeats. Looking at the options: A refers to general DNA repair, not telomerase-specific; C suggests removal rather than addition; D, E, F, G relate to other DNA processes; H is about chromatin structure; I suggests transcription which is incorrect; J is about methylation. Option B correctly describes telomerase adding repetitive sequences to 3' chromosome ends, which is its defining function.", "correct_answer": "B", "confidence": "high", "topic": "molecular_genetics", "subtopic": "Telomeres and telomerase", "category": "molecular_genetics"}

To answer this, I need to recall what we know about histone modifications and their roles in gene regulation. Histone modifications create a 'histone code' that helps regulate chromatin structure and gene expression. Some modifications are associated with transcriptional activation, while others are linked to repression. For active promoters specifically, H3K4me3 (trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3) is the well-established mark. This modification is deposited by SET1-like methyltransferases and is found at the transcription start sites of actively transcribed genes. Looking at the other options: H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 are repressive marks associated with heterochromatin and Polycomb silencing respectively. H4K20me3 is also a repressive mark. H3K36me2/3 is found in gene bodies of actively transcribed genes, not specifically at promoters. H2AK119ub is a Polycomb repressive mark. H3K79me2 is found in transcribed regions but not specifically enriched at promoters. While H4K16ac can be associated with active transcription, it's not the defining mark of active promoters like H3K4me3 is. H3K9me2 is generally repressive, and H3K27me1 is not a well-characterized active mark.", "correct_answer": "C", "confidence": "high", "topic": "molecular_genetics", "subtopic": "Chromatin structure and gene regulation", "category": "molecular_genetics"}
