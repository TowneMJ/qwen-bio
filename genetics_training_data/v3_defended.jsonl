The three key observations perfectly align with Dom34's known function: (1) Accumulation of mRNAs with long poly(A) tails occurs because Dom34-mediated NGD normally triggers degradation of problematic mRNAs - without it, these mRNAs persist; (2) Increased frameshifting results from ribosomes attempting to bypass stall sites without proper rescue mechanisms; (3) Incomplete polypeptides attached to ribosomes accumulate because Dom34 (with Hbs1) normally splits stalled ribosomes and releases nascent chains.

The chromoshadow domain is involved in protein-protein interactions and helps recruit other factors. For epigenetic inheritance, both establishment of silencing and its maintenance across generations are crucial.

It offers precise quantification through Ct values, allowing direct comparison of expression levels between tissues. All other options fail critical requirements: Northern blots lack sensitivity for low-abundance transcripts; regular RT-PCR is only semi-quantitative; Western blots detect proteins not transcripts; Southern blots analyze DNA not RNA; RNA-seq, while sensitive, is unnecessarily expensive and complex for a simple two-tissue comparison; in situ hybridization has limited sensitivity and is semi-quantitative at best; genomic DNA PCR cannot assess expression; immunofluorescence detects proteins; and restriction digestion is irrelevant to expression analysis. The question clearly specifies all necessary parameters that point exclusively to qRT-PCR as the optimal method.", "weak_points": ["RNA-seq (option E) could theoretically work and would provide comprehensive data, but it's overkill for comparing one gene between two tissues and is not the 'most appropriate' choice given the specific, focused nature of the research question"]}}
{"question": "A researcher is studying the expression of a tissue-specific gene in different developmental stages. They perform RT-PCR on RNA samples and observe strong bands in adult heart tissue but no detectable bands in embryonic heart tissue at day 10 of development. However, when they perform Northern blotting on the same RNA samples, they detect a faint band in the embryonic tissue that is absent in their RT-PCR results. What is the most likely explanation for this discrepancy?", "options": {"A": "The gene is not transcribed in embryonic tissue, and the Northern blot result is a false positive", "B": "The RT-PCR primers are specific for a splice variant that is not expressed in embryonic tissue", "C": "The Northern blot is detecting genomic DNA contamination in the embryonic sample", "D": "The reverse transcriptase enzyme failed to work in the embryonic sample", "E": "The gene is expressed at levels below the detection threshold of RT-PCR in embryonic tissue", "F": "The RNA in the embryonic sample was completely degraded", "G": "The PCR amplification step failed due to inhibitors in the embryonic tissue extract", "H": "The Northern blot is detecting a different gene with sequence similarity", "I": "The embryonic tissue sample was contaminated with adult heart tissue", "J": "The RT-PCR reaction lacked sufficient magnesium ions for the embryonic sample"}, "concept_tested": "Understanding the relative sensitivities of different gene expression detection methods and interpreting conflicting experimental results", "reasoning": "The question asks us to explain why RT-PCR shows no signal while Northern blotting shows a faint signal for the same gene in embryonic tissue. First, I need to recall the key principles: RT-PCR involves reverse transcription of mRNA followed by PCR amplification, making it highly sensitive due to the exponential amplification step. Northern blotting directly detects mRNA without amplification, making it less sensitive but more quantitative. The observation that Northern blot detects a faint band while RT-PCR shows nothing suggests the mRNA is present but at very low levels. If the mRNA were absent (option A), Northern blot wouldn't detect it either. If RNA were degraded (option F), neither technique would work. Contamination explanations (options C, I) don't fit because Northern blot specifically detects mRNA, not DNA, and contamination would likely affect both techniques similarly. Technical failures (options D, G, J) would be unusual to occur consistently. The splice variant explanation (option B) is plausible - if the RT-PCR primers span an exon junction that doesn't exist in the embryonic splice variant, RT-PCR would fail while Northern blot (which detects the whole transcript) would still work. However, option E (low expression below RT-PCR detection threshold) seems contradictory since RT-PCR is more sensitive than Northern blot. But actually, this contradiction is the key - if RT-PCR fails due to primer specificity issues while Northern blot succeeds, it points to option B as the most likely explanation.", "correct_answer": "B", "confidence": "high", "topic": "molecular_genetics", "subtopic": "Experimental techniques for studying gene expression (PCR, blotting, sequencing)", "category": "molecular_genetics", "defense": {"can_defend": true, "defense": "This question is defensible because it tests understanding of alternative splicing and the technical differences between RT-PCR and Northern blotting. The key insight is that RT-PCR requires specific primers that bind to particular sequences, while Northern blotting detects all transcripts containing the probe sequence. Option B is definitively correct because it's the only explanation that accounts for both observations: (1) Northern blot detects transcript in embryonic tissue (proving transcription occurs), and (2) RT-PCR fails to amplify (indicating the primer binding sites are absent). This scenario is biologically plausible as developmental splice variants are common. All other options can be eliminated: A contradicts the Northern result; C is impossible as Northern blots use RNA-specific probes; D would affect all genes, not just this one; E contradicts the fact that Northern blotting is generally less sensitive than RT-PCR; F would prevent Northern detection; G would affect other genes too; H requires an improbable coincidence of similar-sized transcripts; I would show strong RT-PCR signal; J would affect all PCR reactions. The question clearly states the same RNA samples were used, eliminating sample-specific technical failures.", "weak_points": ["The question could have been strengthened by mentioning that other control genes amplified successfully in the embryonic RT-PCR to definitively rule out options D, G, and J", "While Northern blotting is typically less sensitive than RT-PCR, making option E unlikely, this relationship could have been made more explicit in the question stem"]}}
