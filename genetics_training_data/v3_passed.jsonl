{"question": "A researcher studying cellular aging creates two cell lines: one with normal telomerase activity and another with a mutation that reduces telomerase activity by 90%.

Let me work through the relevant biology: Telomerase adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends, maintaining telomere length. When telomerase activity is reduced, telomeres progressively shorten with each cell division. Critically short telomeres lose their protective cap structure and are no longer recognized as natural chromosome ends. Instead, the DNA damage response machinery recognizes these uncapped telomeres as double-strand breaks. This triggers inappropriate DNA repair responses, including non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which attempts to 'repair' these ends by fusing them to other chromosome ends. This leads to chromosome fusions and subsequent genomic instability as fused chromosomes create problems during cell division.

C, F, G, H, I, and J describe other cellular processes not directly related to telomere function. D and E describe indirect effects that aren't the primary mechanism.

The proteasome is responsible for targeted protein degradation, so when it's inhibited, proteins that are normally rapidly degraded will accumulate.

When degradation is blocked, protein accumulates dramatically. Options involving mRNA issues (A, C, E, G, I) don't explain why proteasome inhibition increases protein levels. Options about protein detection issues (D, F) don't explain the biological regulation. Option H (export) is implausible for a transcription factor.

{"question": "A researcher studying translation quality control observes that cells with a defective Dom34 protein accumulate mRNAs with long stretches of rare codons and show increased production of truncated proteins.

Let's analyze the key observations: 1) Defective Dom34 leads to accumulation of mRNAs with rare codons, 2) Increased truncated proteins are produced, 3) Cycloheximide treatment (which blocks translocation) reduces truncated protein production. We need to recall that Dom34 is part of the no-go decay pathway that rescues stalled ribosomes. When ribosomes stall on rare codons (due to slow tRNA delivery), they need to be rescued to prevent aberrant protein production. The logic: If Dom34 is defective, stalled ribosomes cannot be properly rescued, leading to either ribosome drop-off (producing truncated proteins) or mRNA cleavage and degradation. The cycloheximide effect is key - by blocking translocation, it prevents ribosomes from reaching the stalling sequences, thus reducing the need for rescue and decreasing truncated protein production. This points to Dom34's role in rescuing stalled ribosomes rather than preventing stalling, enhancing tRNA function, or other alternatives.

These observations collectively point to a defect in a quality control mechanism that normally deals with stalled or problematic ribosomes. Dom34 (along with Hbs1) is a key component of the no-go decay pathway, which recognizes ribosomes that have stalled on mRNAs (often due to secondary structures, rare codons, or other obstacles) and helps rescue these ribosomes while targeting the problematic mRNAs for degradation. When this pathway is defective, we would expect exactly what's observed: accumulation of the problematic mRNAs (because they're not being degraded), more frameshifting events (because ribosomes struggle with obstacles), and stalled ribosomes with incomplete peptides.

Let me work through the relevant principles: During cell differentiation, specific gene expression programs are established through chromatin modifications. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) remove acetyl groups from histones, generally leading to chromatin compaction and gene silencing. When cells differentiate into neurons, they must not only activate neural genes but also permanently silence genes for other cell types (like muscle genes) through repressive chromatin marks.
