Thus it does not require post-transcriptional modification. In Eukaryotes the primary transcript of mRNA is the hn RNA (hetrogeneous nuclear RNA). After transcription hnRNA is extensively modified to form functional mRNA. These modifications are as follows.The 51-cappingThis is the first processing reaction. 5l-end of mRNA is capped with 7-methylguansosine. This cap helps in initiation of translation (protein synthesis) and stabilizes the structure of mRNA by protecting from 5'-exonuclease.Addition of poly 'A' tail As the name suggests, multiple4A' (adenylate) residues are added at 31 end.This poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA. but rather added after transcription. These tails helps to stabilize the mRNA (by protecting from 31-exonuclease), facilitate exit from the nucleus, and aid in translation. After mRNA enters the cytosol, the poly-A tail is gradually shortened. Some mRNAs do not have poly-A tail, e.g. mRNAs of histones and some interferons.Removal of introns (splicing) Eukaryotic genes contain some coding sequences which code for protein and some intervening non-coding sequences which do not code for protein. The coding sequences are called 'exons'and intervening non-coding sequences are called 'introns'. The process by which introns are excised and exons are linked to form functional mRNA is called splicing. Thus mature mRNA does not contain introns.# Spitcesome :- Splicesome is an assembly made up of small nuclear RNA (snRNA), some proteins and hnRNA. snRNA combines with proteins to form small nuclear ribnonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs or snurps) that mediate splicing. It is snRNA component of snurps that catalyzes splicing. Snurps are U1, U2, U3, U4, U5 and U6-o Only about 1[?]5% of human DNA has coding sequence (exons). Remaining is non-coding (introns).Alternate splicing :- The hn-RNA molecules from some genes can be spliced in alternative way in different tissues. Thus two or more different mRNA (and therefore 2 or more proteins) can be synthesized from same hnRNA. For example, difference isoforms of tropomyosin in different tissues in due to alternate splicing.\n\nThe answer is D. Glycosylation"}]}

Histone acetylation and deacetylation are essential pas of gene regulation. These reactions are typically catalysed by enzymes with \"histone acetyltransferase\" (HAT) or \"histone deacetylase\" (HDAC) activity. Acetylation is the process where an acetyl functional group is transferred from one molecule (in this case, Acetyl-Coenzyme A) to another. Deacetylation is simply the reverse reaction where an acetyl group is removed from a molecule. Acetylated histones, octameric proteins that organize chromatin into nucleosomes and ultimately higher order structures, represent a type of epigenetic marker within chromatin. Acetylation removes the positive charge on the histones, thereby decreasing the interaction of the N termini of histones with the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. As a consequence, the condensed chromatin is transformed into a more relaxed structure that is associated with greater levels of gene transcription. This relaxation can be reversed by HDAC activity. Relaxed, transcriptionally active DNA is referred to as euchromatin. More condensed (tightly packed) DNA is referred to as heterochromatin. Condensation can be brought about by processes including deacetylation and methylation; the action of methylation is indirect and has no effect upon charge.\n\nThe answer is B.

The plant grows tall if the plant has TT or Tt and the plant remains dwarf if the plant has tt. In this example, plant being tall and plant being short are the two phenotypes. Hence phenotypes are the external manifestations of a genome. Genotypes are genetic expressions of a trait. Just by looking at something, if we can comment whether the plant can grow tall or if the plant has to remain dwarf is called as genotypes. So there are three genotypes - TT, Tt, tt. What are alleles? T is one allele and t is another allele. So alleles are alternating forms of the same gene.* Genotype is the genetic expression of a trait* Phenotype is the physical expression of a trait* Alleles are alternating forms of the same gene - in the sense they differ by a few nucleotide sequences so that aminoacid sequences of the polypeptide chain gets affected minimally - so that the function of the protein gets affected either qualitatively or quantitatively.* Polymorphism is presence of multiple alleles at a single locus giving rise to multiple phenotypes, provided the prevalence of the alleles in a general population is more than 1%# For example, hair colour - we do not say only black hair is normal, various shades of brown and even white hair in a blonde person is normal. This is because of the presence of multiple alleles - an allele produces black pigment, many alleles to produces various shades of brown and then an allele which does not produce pigment - causing blonde hair.# In this example the last allele which has failed to produce the respective protein should be considered as a defective allele. But we consider it as a normal allele based on prevalence. As prevalence of the allele which can not produce the pigment is more than 1% in the general population, we call it as a normal allele.\n\nThe answer is B. Phenotype"}]}

Proteins are built from smaller units called amino acids, which are specified by three-nucleotide mRNA sequences called codons. Each codon represents a paicular amino acid, and each codon is recognized by a specific tRNA. The tRNA molecule has a distinctive folded structure with three hairpin loops that form the shape of a three-leafed clover. One of these hairpin loops contains a sequence called the anticodon, which can recognize and decode a mRNA codon. Each tRNA has its corresponding amino acid attached to its end. When a tRNA recognizes and binds to its corresponding codon in the ribosome, the tRNA transfers the appropriate amino acid to the end of the growing amino acid chain. Then the tRNAs and ribosome continue to decode the mRNA molecule until the entire sequence is translated into a protein.Ref:<a href=\"\n\nThe answer is A. tRNA"}]}

These genes can change the properties of the bacterial cell. This process is called lysogenic conversion.[?]Bacteriophages: Lysogenic Conversion-Some lysogenic phage carry genes that can enhance the virulence of the bacterial host.-For example, some phage carry genes that encode toxins.-These genes, once integrated into the bacterial chromosome, can cause the once harmless bacteria to release potent toxins that can cause disease.[?]Transcription-Transcription is the process of making a complementary molecule of mRNA (messenger RNA) from a DNA template. This takes place in the nucleus.-RNA polymerase unwinds, reads and places the correct nucleotide on the mRNA strand according to base pairing rules (A to U, C to G, T to A).[?]Transformation:oIntroduction of an exogenous DNA into cell, causing the cell to acquire a new phenotype.oInfection of Bacterium by phage begins with injection of its DNA.oIt can take either of 2 causes 1 lysogenic - viral DNA becomes as part of Bacterial DNA causing cell division.oLytic-viral DNA excises from host chromosome and replicates itself, Direct synthesis of viral proteins - then lysis of host occurs with release of viri.oTransduction is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell by a virus or viral vector. An example is the viral transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another.oTransformation is one of three processes for horizontal gene transfer, in which exogenous genetic material passes from one bacterium to another, the other two being conjugation (transfer of genetic material between two bacterial cells in direct contact) and transduction (injection of foreign DNA by a bacteriophage virus into the host bacterium). In transformation, the genetic material passes through the intervening medium, and uptake is completely dependent on the recipient bacterium.\n\nThe answer is A. Transduction"}]}

The process of polyadenylation begins as the transcription of a gene terminates. The 3'-most segment of the newly made pre-mRNA is first cleaved off by a set of proteins; these proteins then synthesize the poly(A) tail at the RNA's 3' end. In some genes, these proteins add a poly(A) tail at one of several possible sites.

They are progressive disorders characterized by lysosomal accumulation of GAGs in various tissues, causing a range of symptoms, such as skeletal and extracellular matrix deformities, and intellectual disability. All are autosomal recessive disorders except Hunter syndrome, which is X linked. Children who are homozygous for any one of these diseases are apparently normal at bih and then gradually deteriorate. In severe cases, death occurs in childhood. There currently is no cure. Incomplete lysosomal degradation of GAGs results in the presence of oligosaccharides in the urine. These fragments can be used to diagnose the specific mucopolysaccharidosis by identifying the structure present on the nonreducing end of the oligosaccharide, because that residue would have been the substrate for the missing enzyme. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the patient's cellular level of the lysosomal hydrolases. Bone marrow and cord blood transplants, in which transplanted macrophages produce the enzymes that degrade GAGs, have been used to treat Hurler and Hunter syndromes, with limited success.

The most common mutation is C1824T, in which the normal cytosine at position 1,824 of the gene is replaced by a thymine. This is a silent mutation as far as the protein is concerned-G608G. However, the introduction of the T creates a cryptic splice site in the gene, such that as the hnRNA is processed, a lamin A mRNA is created that is missing 150 nucleotides, corresponding to a loss of 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminal of the protein. Under normal conditions, lamin A is farnesylated, which allows the protein to be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. During processing, the enzyme AMPSTE24 cleaves part of the carboxy terminal, releasing the farnesylated portion of the protein such that lamin A can be transferred to the nucleus, where it is involved in providing a scaffold for the nuclear membrane. In the mutant protein (progerin), the site of cleavage is lost owing to the loss of the C-terminal amino acids, although the site of farnesylation still remains. Thus, the progerin that reaches the nucleus is still bound to the nuclear membrane, distorting the nuclear membrane and contributing to nuclear instability. Chromatin binding to the nuclear membrane is also altered, as are the phosphorylation sites in progerin, which makes it more difficult for the nuclear membrane to dissolve during mitosis. Because this is a silent mutation in the mature protein, the tertiary structure of the protein is not altered, and a premature stop codon has not been introduced into the protein (that would be a nonsense mutation, not a silent mutation). Since the protein amino acid sequence is initially the same, an alternative start site for transcription has not been created, nor does a simple base change lead to an inhibition of DNA replication.\n\nThe answer is D.

As the RNA polymerase approaches the end of the gene being transcribed, it hits a region rich in C and G nucleotides. The RNA transcribed from this region folds back on itself, and the complementary C and G nucleotides bind together. The result is a stable hairpin that causes the polymerase to stall. In a terminator, the hairpin is followed by a stretch of U nucleotides in the RNA, which match up with A nucleotides in the template DNA. The complementary U-A region of the RNA transcript forms only a weak interaction with the template DNA. This, coupled with the stalled polymerase, produces enough instability for the enzyme to fall off and liberate the new RNA transcript.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a test tube method for amplifying a selected DNA sequence that does not rely on the biologic cloning method. PCR permits the synthesis of millions of copies of a specific nucleotide sequence in a few hours.b. It can amplify the sequence, even when the targeted sequence makes up less than one part in a million of the total initial sample. The method can be used to amplify DNA sequences from any source--bacterial, viral, plant, or animal.A. Steps of a PCRPCR uses DNA polymerase to repetitively amplify targeted portions of DNA. Each cycle of amplification doubles the amount of DNA in the sample, leading to an exponential increase in DNA with repeated cycles of amplification. The amplified DNA sequence can then be analyzed by gel electrophoresis, Southern hybridization, or direct sequence determination.a. Primer construction: It is not necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of the target DNA in the PCR method. However, it is necessary to know the nucleotide sequence of short segments on each side of the target DNA. These stretches, called flanking sequences, bracket the DNA sequence of interest. The nucleotide sequences of the flanking regions are used to construct two, single-stranded oligonucleotides, usually 20-35 nucleotides long, which are complementary to the respective flanking sequences. The 3'-hydroxyl end of each primer points toward the target sequence. These synthetic oligonucleotides function as primers in PCR reactions.b. Denature the DNA: The DNA to be amplified is heated to separate the double-stranded target DNA into single strands.c. Annealing of primers to ssDNA: The separated strands are cooled and allowed to anneal to the two primers (one for each strand).d. Chain extension: DNA polymerase and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (in excess) are added to the mixture to initiate the synthesis of two new chains complementary to the original DNA chains. DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl end of the primer, and strand growth extends across the target DNA, making complementary copies of the target. At the completion of one cycle of replication, the reaction mixture is heated again to denature the DNA strands (of which there are now four). Each DNA strand binds a complementary primer, and the cycle of chain extension is repeated. By using a heat-stable DNA polymerase (for example, Taq polymerase) from a bacterium (for example, Thermus aquaticus) that normally lives at high temperatures (a thermophilic bacterium), the polymerase is not denatured and, therefore, does not have to be added at each successive cycle. Typically 20-30 cycles are run during this process, amplifying the DNA by a million-fold to a billion-fold. e. Dideoxy ribonucleotides look exactly like deoxyribonucleotides except that they no OH group on the third carbon of the sugar.f. This has very serious implications. These nucleotides can add to the growing DNA chain (because they have a phosphate on their fifth carbon that can link to the hydroxyl on the third carbon of the nucleotide at the end of the growing chain) but once on, no additional nucleotides can be added.g. In other words, dideoxy ribonucleotides act as chain terminators. When they are incorporated, the polymerization ends. It is the ability to end chains with these molecules that is the basis for DNA sequencing by the Sanger procedure.\n\nThe answer is C. Dideoxy ribonucleotides"}]}

This compound is an inducer that binds to the repressor protein, changing its configuration so that it can no longer bind to the operator.# In absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase is active and sufficient quantitive of cAMP are made and bind to the CAP-binding site, causing RNA polymerase to more efficiently initiate transcription at the promoter site.# This is an eg. of positive regulation3) When both glucose and lactose are available -# In this case transcription of lac operon is negligible, even if lactose is present at a higher concentration.# Adenylyl cyclase is deactivated in the presence of glucose-a process known as catabolite repression, So no cAMP-CAP complex forms and the CAP binding site remains empty.# RNA polymerase is unable to effectively initiate the transcription, even though the repressor may not be bound to the operator region.\n\nThe answer is A.

Purine synthesis (Figure I below)(1). The purine base is synthesized on the ribose moiety.(a). 5'-Phosphoribosyl-1'-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which provides the ribose moiety, reacts with glutamine to form phosphoribosyl amine.(b). This first step in purine biosynthesis produces N9 of the purine ring and is inhibited by AMP and guanosine monophosphate (GMP).(c). The entire glycine molecule is added to the growing purine precursor. Then, C8 is added by formyl-FH4 , N3 by glutamine, C6 by CO2 , N1 by aspartate, and C2 by formyl-FH4 (see Figure I-A).(d). IMP, which contains the base hypoxanthine, is generated.1. IMP is cleaved in the liver. Its free base, or nucleoside, travels to various tissues where it is reconverted to the nucleotide(2). IMP is the precursor of both AMP and GMP.(a). Each product, by feedback inhibition, regulates its own synthesis from the IMP branch point as well as inhibits the initial step in the pathway.(b). AMP and GMP can be phosphorylated to the triphosphate level.(c). The nucleotide triphosphates (ATP and guanosine triphosphate ) can be used for energy requiring processes or for RNA synthesis.(3). The reduction of the ribose moiety to deoxyribose occurs at the diphosphate level and is catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase, which requires the protein thioredoxin.(a). After the diphosphates are phosphorylated, deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) and deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) can be used for DNA synthesis.(4). Purine bases can be salvaged and converted between free bases, nucleotides, and nucleosides by a series of reactions, as indicated in Figure II.b. Purine degradation (Figure III)(1). In the degradation of the purine nucleotides, phosphate and ribose are removed first and then the nitrogenous base is oxidized.(a). The degradation of guanine produces xanthine.(b). The degradation of adenine produces hypoxanthine, which is oxidized to xanthine by xanthine oxidase; this enzyme requires molybdenum.(c). Xanthine is oxidized to uric acid by xanthine oxidase.(d). Uric acid, which is not very water soluble, is excreted by the kidneys.c. Pyrimidine synthesis (see Figure I)(1). The pyrimidine base is synthesized prior to the addition of the ribose moiety.(a). In the first reaction, glutamine reacts with CO2 and 2 ATP to form carbamoyl phosphate. This reaction is analogous to the first reaction of the urea cycle. However, for pyrimidine synthesis, glutamine provides the nitrogen, and the reaction occurs in the cytosol, where it is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II, which is inhibited by UTP.(b). The entire aspartate molecule adds to carbamoyl phosphate. The molecule closes to yield a ring, which is oxidized, forming orotate.(c). Orotate reacts with PRPP, producing orotidine-5'-phosphate, which is decarboxylated to form UMP.(2). UMP is phosphorylated to UTP, which obtains an amino group from glutamine to form cytidine triphosphate (CTP). UTP and CTP are used in the synthesis of RNA.(3). The ribose moiety of cytidine diphosphate (CDP) is reduced to deoxyribose, forming deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP). Ribonucleotide reductase is the enzyme.(a). Deoxycytidine diphosphate (dCDP) is deaminated and dephosphorylated to form dUMP.(b). dUMP is converted to dTMP by methylene-FH4 .(c). Phosphorylations produce deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and deoxythymidine triphosphate, which are the precursors of DNA.d. Pyrimidine degradation(1). In pyrimidine degradation, the carbons produce CO2 , and the nitrogen produce urea.The professor is suffering from gout, caused by an accumulation of uric acid in the blood and precipitation of the uric acid in his big toe. Xanthine oxidase is involved in the conversion of the purine bases to uric acid. It catalyzes the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and of xanthine to uric acid. Allopurinol is used as a maintenance medication in the treatment of gout and acts as a suicide substrate that blocks xanthine oxidase activity. This results in lower concentrations of uric acid (so the uric acid in the blood will not precipitate) and higher concentrations of the more water-soluble compounds hypoxanthine (derived from adenine) and xanthine (derived from guanine).I. De novo synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. Ribonucleotide reductase (RR) catalyzes the reduction of the ribose moiety in ADP, GDP, and CDP to deoxyribose.

A DNA sequence is a chain of many smaller molecules called nucleotides. DNA (or RNA) nucleotide sequences are read three nucleotides at a time in units called codons, and each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stops signal. During translation, the sequence of codons is read in order from the nucleotide sequence to synthesize a chain of amino acids and form a protein. Frameshift mutations arise when the normal sequence of codons is disrupted by the inseion or deletion of one or more nucleotides, provided that the number of nucleotides added or removed is not a multiple of three. For instance, if just one nucleotide is deleted from the sequence, then all of the codons including and after the mutation will have a disrupted reading frame. This can result in the incorporation of many incorrect amino acids into the protein. In contrast, if three nucleotides are inseed or deleted, there will be no shift in the codon reading frame; however, there will be either one extra or one missing amino acid in the final protein. Therefore, frameshift mutations result in abnormal protein products with an incorrect amino acid sequence that can be either longer or shoer than the normal protein.

At times, the protease elastase escapes from the neutrophils, and is inactivated by A1AT. In the absence of functional A1AT, the elastase destroys the lung cells, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will occur very early in life. If the patient smokes, the condition is greatly exacerbated. A common mutation in A1AT leads to misfolding and accumulation of the misfolded form of the protein in the liver. The accumulation of this inactive, misfolded protein can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and eventually liver failure.\n\nThe answer is C. Codominant"}]}

These are - Promoter-proximal sequences (or simply promoters):- These are consensus sequences, which lies close to the initiation site of transcription. These can be divided into : -i) Promoters which define where transcription is to commence These are -TATA Box (Hogness box) It is nearly identical to that of pribnow box of prokaryotic promoter region. It is found - 25 base pairs i.e. 25 bp upstream (towards 5l end) from transcription initiation site.Initiator sequence (Inr)Is is found -3 bp (upstream) to +5 bp (downstream) from initiaton site.Down stream promotor element (DPE)It is found -25 bp (downstream) from initiation site. It is the only exception ofpromoter sequences, which is a part of structural gene itself.# The human (eukaryotic) RNA polymerase cannot bind to these promoior directly. Transcription factor IID{TFIID) directs the binding of RNA polymerase to promoter sequence. TF II D is made up of two components : TATA binding protein (TBP) and TBP associated factors (TAFs). The TATA box is bound by TBP subunits of TF II D and directs the binding of RNA polymerase. Inr and DPE are bound by TAF subunits of TF II D to direct the binding of RNA polymerase,ii) Promoters which define how frequently transcription will occur These are - GCbox;- It is found anywhere between -75 to -25 bp from initiation site. It binds to SP-1 protein.b) CAA T boxIt is found at -7 5 bp from initiation site. It binds to C A AT binding transcription factor (C T F). Enhancers :- These are DNA sequences that increase the rate of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. These are located far away from the initiation site.

Uncondensed chromosomes are more prone to get expressed. Hence Histone acetylation is found to increase the level of gene expression* Methylation of Cytidine of CG islands is found to cause condensation of chromosomes. This in turn decreases the level of gene expression* Epigenetic alterations are preserved during cell division. It is also propogated to progeny by a process called as transgenerational epigenetic inheritance* Thus epigenetics is a heritable change in the levels of gene expression not mediated by changes in DNA or gene sequence.\n\nThe answer is C.

Alteration"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ans. A. Positive regulationThe lac operona. An operon can be regulated by a single promoter or regulatory region. The cistron is the smallest unit of genetic expression.b. When E coli is exposed to both lactose and glucose as sources of carbon, the organisms first metabolize the glucose and then temporarily stop growing until the genes of the lac operon become induced to provide the ability to metabolize lactose as a usable energy source. Although lactose is present from the beginning of the bacterial growth phase, the cell does not induce those enzymes necessary for catabolism of lactose until the glucose has been exhausted. This phenomenon was first thought to be attributable to repression of the lac operon by some catabolite of glucose; hence, it was termed catabolite repression.c. It is now known that catabolite repression is in fact mediated by a catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) in conjunction with cAMP. This protein is also referred to as the cAMP regulatory protein (CRP). The expression of many inducible enzyme systems or operons in E coli and other prokaryotes is sensitive to catabolite repression.d. The lactose (lac) operon is a classic model for understanding gene regulation. It is negatively controlled through two regulatory genes--the lac I gene that constitutively (always) expresses a repressor protein and the operator (o) region to which the repressor binds. The lac operon is inducible by lactose and lactose analogues, inactivating the repressor and uncovering the operon and its neighboring promoter (p) sequence.e. Several operons in E. coli, including the lac operon, are subject to catabolite repression. In the presence of glucose, there is decreased manufacture of cyclic AMP (cAMP) by adenylate cyclase. Low glucose levels increase production of cAMP, which binds to the catabolite activator protein (CAP). The cAMP-CAP complex binds to the promoters of several responsive operons at catabolite activator protein (CAP) binding sites, greatly enhancing transcription of operon RNA. This positive control stimulates use of more exotic metabolites when glucose is not available and conserves energy when glucose is plentiful. High levels of glucose lower cAMP levels and direct metabolism toward constitutive glucose pathways such as glycolysis.\n\nThe answer is A. Positive regulation"}]}

The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, who published their findings in 1964. The HGP deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. This results in both hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a paicularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington&;s disease.

Ordinarily, no transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule can recognize a nonsense codon; therefore, protein synthesis terminates when the ribosome reaches such a codon. A nonsense suppressor mutation usually involves the mutation of a tRNA gene, so that the anticodon of the tRNA is altered to a sequence that is complementary to a nonsense codon. The altered tRNA can then bind to the nonsense codon and inse an amino acid at that point in the protein sequence. Thus, protein synthesis is allowed to continue, and the nonsense mutation is suppressed. A silent mutation is one that causes no change in the amino acid sequence of a protein. A missense mutation causes a single amino acid change. A frameshift mutation is the result of an inseion or deletion that alters the reading frame of the ribosome, leading to the production of a garbled amino acid sequence. Ref : Biochemistry by U.

Langman Embryology 9th/pg. 5; Harper's 27th/pg. 326; Ganong 23rd/Figure 1-13)MITOSISIt is the process whereby one cell divides, giving rise to two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell.Each daughter cell receives the complete complement of 46 chromosomes. Before a cell enters mitosis, each chromosome replicates its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). During this replication phase the chromosomes are extremely long, they spread diffusely through the nucleus, and they cannot be recognized with the light microscope. With the onset of mitosis the chromosomes begin to coil, contract, and condense; these events mark the beginning of prophase. Each chromosome now consists of two parallel subunits, chromatids, that are joined at a narrow region common to both called the centromere. Throughout prophase the chromosomes continue to condense, shorten, and thicken, but only at prometaphase do the chromatids become distinguishable. During metaphase the chromosomes line up in the equatorial plane. And their doubled structure is clearly visible. Each is attached by microtubules extending from the centromere to the centriole, forming the mi- totic spindle. Soon the centromere of each chromosome divides, marking the beginning of anaphase, followed by migration of chromatids to opposite poles of the spindle. Finally, during telophase, chromosomes uncoil and lengthen, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the cytoplasm divides. Each daughter cell receives half of all doubled chromosome material and thus maintains the same number of chromosomes as the mother cell.Meiosis is the cell division that takes place in the germ cells to generate male and female gametes, sperm and egg cells, respectivelyPermanent cellsRemain in G0, regenerate from stem cells.Neurons, skeletal and cardiac muscle cells, and RBCs remain in G0.Stable (quiescent) cellsEnter G1 from G0 when stimulated.Hepatocytes, lymphocytes.Labile cellsNever go to G0, divide rapidly with a short Gl.Bone marrow, gut epithelium, skin, hair follicles.Also remember:# The centromere is an adenine-thymine (A-T) rich region ranging in size from 102 to 106 base pairs. It binds several proteins with high affinity. This complex, called the kinetochore, provides the anchor for the mitotic spindle. It thus is an essential structure for chromosomal segregation during mitosis.# The ends of each chromosome contain structures called telomeres. Telomeres consist of short, repeat TG-rich sequences.# Telomerase, a multisubunit RNA-containing complex related to viral RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (reverse transcriptases), is the enzyme responsible for telomere synthesis and thus for maintaining the length of the telomere.# Since telomere shortening has been associated with both malignant transformation and aging, telomerase has become an attractive target for cancer chemotherapy and drug development.\n\nThe answer is A.

It states that (1) only one of the X chromosomes is genetically active, (2) the other X of either maternal or paternal origin undergoes heteropyknosis and is rendered inactive, (3) inactivation of either the maternal or paternal X occurs at random among all the cells of the blastocyst on or about day 16 of embryonic life, and (4) inactivation of the same X chromosome persists in all the cells derived from each precursor cell.The inactive X can be seen in the interphase nucleus as a darkly staining small mass in contact with the nuclear membrane known as the Barr body, or X chromatin. The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a unique gene called XIST, whose product is a noncoding RNA that is retained in the nucleus, where it \"coats\" the X chromosome that it is transcribed from and initiates a gene-silencing process by chromatin modification and DNA methylation.

In brief, it proposes that successive DNA mutations in a single cell cause cancer (monoclonality). This theory places carcinogenesis at the cellular and subcellular hierarchical levels of biological complexity. Its basic premises are that (1) cancer is a defect of the control of cell proliferation and (2) the default state of metazoan cells is quiescence. These two premises have recently been contradicted by evidence. Suppoers of the theory have dealt with these lacks of fit by incorporating ad hoc explanations similar to the use of epicycles in pre-Copernican astronomy. We propose the adoption of an alternative theory, the tissue organization field theory of carcinogenesis and neoplasia. Its basic premises are that (1) proliferation is the default state of all cells and (2) carcinogenesis and neoplasia are defects of tissue architecture. Carcinogens would act initially by disrupting the normal interactions that take place among cells in the parenchyma and stroma of an organ (the equivalent of the \"morphogenetic fields\" of developing organisms). Stroma appears as the primary target of carcinogens. Carcinogenesis and neoplasia occur entirely through emergent (supracellular) phenomena. Neoplastic cells may be reprogrammed to behave like \"normal\" cells within normal tissues. We argue that it is necessary to abandon the somatic mutation theory. Researchers will then become free to adopt alternative reliable premises to build a theory that explains carcinogenesis as another outcome, aberrant as it may be, of biological organization.\n\nThe answer is A.

PCR provides a sensitive, selective, and extremely rapid means of amplifying any desired sequence of DNA. Specificity is based on the use of two oligonucleotide primers that hybridize to complementary sequences on opposite strands of DNA and flank the target sequence. DNA synthesis is catalyzed by a heat-stable DNA polymerase purified from one of a number of different thermophilic bacteria, organisms that grow at 70degC to 80degC. Thermostable DNA polymerases withstand sho incubations at over 90deg, temperatures required to completely denature DNA. These thermostable DNA polymerases have made automation of PCR possible.DNA sequences as sho as 50 to 100 bp and as long as 10 kb can be amplified by PCR. Twenty cycles provide an amplification of 106 (ie, 220) and 30 cycles, 109 (230). Each cycle takes <=5 to 10 minutes so that even large DNA molecules can be amplified rapidly. The PCR allows the DNA in a single cell, hair follicle, or spermatozoon to be amplified and analyzed. The PCR is also used (1) to detect infectious agents, especially latent viruses; (2) to make prenatal genetic diagnoses; (3) to detect allelic polymorphisms; (4) to establish precise tissue types for transplants; and (5) to study evolution, using DNA from archeological samples (6) for quantitative RNA analyses after RNA copying and mRNA quantitation by the so-called -PCR method (cDNA copies of mRNA generated by a retroviral reverse transcriptase) or (7) to score in vivo protein-DNA occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays.Ref: HArper&;s Biochemistry; 30th edition; Page no: 459\n\nThe answer is A.

If a purine is replaced by another purine base or if a pyrimidine base is replaced by another pyrimidine base, it is known as transition. Substitution of a purine base by a pyrimidine base or vice versa is known as transversion. A point mutation mil affect only one codon. Point mutation can be of following types >Silent mutationo If the substitution occurs in the third base of a codon, the code word may remain unchanged due to degeneracy of the genetic code. For example, GGC to GGG mutation has no effect as both code for glycine thus, codon containing the changed base codes for the same amino acidQ, therefore there is no change in amino acid sequence of the protein. The gene is expressed in term of same protein, Le. there is no change in expression of proteinQMis-sense mutationso If the base substitution changes the code words, i.e. codon containing the changed base codes for different amino acid(AIIMS-02),it is called mis-sense mutation. The sequence of amino acids in the protein changes. The effect of amino acid substitution is variable :-i) Acceptable missense mutation:- The substitution of amino acid has minimal or no effect because either the substituted amino acid is similar to that of original amino acid or the substitution occurs in non critical area. For example, normally hemoglobin (HbA) has valine at position 67 of b-chain in place of valine. This is non-critical position, i.e. substitution of different amino-acid 'at this position produces normally functional hemoglobin. For example, 'hemoglobin Milwaukee' has glutamic acid at this positionQ (in place of valine), 'hemoglobin bristoF has aspartic acidQ and hemoglobin Sydney' has alnine (in place of valine).Partially acceptable mis-sence mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other is partially acceptable, i.e. the resultant protein functions normally under certain conditions but not always. For example, substitution of glutamate by valine at position six of b-chain produces HbS. HbS is able to function normally at high oxygen tension but gets precipitated at low oxygen tension.Unacceptable mis-sense mutation:- Substitution of one amino acid with other produces non-functional protein. For example, in methemoglobin (HbM) histidine is replacement by tyrosine at position 58 of a- chain. HbM is incapable of combining with oxygen.C) Nonsence MutationQo Base substitution changes a sense codon into a nonsense (stop or termination) codon. In such cases, protein synthesis will be terminated prematurely and the resulting protein will be usually non-functional.Frame-shift mutationo Frameshift mutationsQ occur due to insertion or deletion0 of one or two bases which causes change in the reading frame distal to the mutation. If 1 or 2 base pair change, whole reading frame is changed distal to the mutation, resulting into entirely different protein molecule.If 3 base pairs change, single amino acid is incorporated or deleted. The rest of amino acid sequence is same.Trinucleotide repeat mutationQo In this type of mutation a codon (i.e. trinucleotide sequence) undergoes amplification and the same codon is repeated continuously so many times in the chain. Diseases associated with trinucleotide repeat mutation are Huntington's diseaseQ (CAG repeat), Spinocerebellar ataxiaQ (CAG repeat), friedreich ataxia (GAA repeat), fragile-X-syndrome (GGG or GCC repeat), dystrophia myotonica (CTG/CUG repeat), X-linked spinobulbar muscular atrophy (CAG repeat) and dentorubral pallidoiusian atrophy (CAG repeat).\n\nThe answer is A.

Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene-environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair color gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles. The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affects an organism&;s traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.\n\nThe answer is A.

When the electric current is switched on, the DNA fragments move from negatively charged electrode to positively charged electrode and the separation is based on length. But when the size of the DNA fragments to be separated is more than 15 to 20 KB, they all move together and create a broader band. Hence to improve the resolution, the voltage direction is changed frequently. This is called as pulsed gel electrophoresis. In this case, the larger fragments take longer time to realign and hence they get separated from relatively smaller fragments. Hence resolution for separating larger fragments is increased.\n\nThe answer is A. DNA"}]}

Both isoforms are coded by APOB and by a single mRNA transcript larger than 16 kb. ApoB48 is generated when a stop codon (UAA) at residue 2153 is created by RNA editing. There appears to be a trans-acting tissue-specific splicing gene that determines which isoform is ultimately produced. Alternatively, there is some evidence that a cis-acting element several thousand bp upstream determines which isoform is produced. As a result of the RNA editing, ApoB48 and ApoB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, but ApoB48 lacks ApoB100's C-terminal LDL receptor binding region. In fact, ApoB48 is so called because it constitutes 48% of the sequence for ApoB100. ApoB 48 is a unique protein to chylomicrons from the small intestine.

Ch. 103, 357)THE CELL CYCLE (G, A G2 and M)# During development from stem to fully differentiated, cells in the body alternately divide (mitosis) and \"appear\" to be resting (interphase). This sequence of activities exhibited by cells is called the cell cycle.# Interphase:- Interphase generally lasts at least 12 to 24 hours in mammalian tissue.- During this period, cell is constantly synthesizing RNA, producing protein, and growing in size.- The inactive X can be seen in the interphase nucleus as a darkly staining small mass in contact with the nuclear membrane known as the Barr body or X chromatin.- By studying molecular events in cells, scientists have determined that interphase i.e. the cell cycle can be divided into 4 phases:# Phase of cell cycle:GO (Resting phase)There are times when a cell will leave the cycle and quit dividing.This may be a temporary resting period or more permanent.An example of the latter is a cell that has reached an end stage of development and will no longer divide (e.g. neuron).G1 (Gap 1)Cells increase in size in Gap 1, crocface RNA os well as synthesizAn important cell cycle control mechanism activated during this period (G1 Checkpoint) ensures that everything is ready for DNA synthesis i.e. the cell determines its readiness to commit to DNA synthesis.S(DNA synthesis)To produce two similar daughter cells, the complete DNA instructions in the cell must be duplicated. DNA replication occurs during this S (synthesis) phase.Thus the genetic material is replicated and no re-replication is permitted. In-situ DNA nick end labeling can quantitative fraction of cells in synthetic (S) phase of cell cycle.G2 (Gap 2)During the gap between DNA synthesis and mitosis, the cell will continue to grow and produce new proteins.At the end of this gap is another control checkpoint (G2 Checkpoint) to determine if the cell can now proceed to enter M (mitosis) and divide.Thus then fidelity of DNA replication is assessed and errors are corrected.Mitosis or M phaseCell growth and protein production stop at this stage in the cell cycle. All of the cell's energy is focused on the complex and orderly division into two similar daughter cells.Thus, the replicated chromosomes are separated and packaged into new nuclei by mitosis and the cytoplasm is divided between the two daughter cells by cytokinesis.Mitosis is much shorter than interphase, lasting perhaps only one to two hours.As in both G1 and G2, there is a Checkpoint in the middle of mitosis (Metaphase Checkpoint) that ensures the cell is ready to complete cell division.# The continuously dividing human cell takes approximately 22 hours to divide.# Normally time required for different phases are as follows:- G2 takes five hours,- M phase takes one hour,- S phase takes eight hours, and- G1 phase takes eight hours.# However the time required for G, and G2 phase are characteristically variable.# Most normal cells are in G() phase and rapidly dividing cells have shorter G, phase.# It is notable that tumor cells can no longer enter G0 phase.# The cells in G2M, especially in M-phase, are most radiosensitive.# The cells in S phase are radioresistant.Also remember:a) Cell cycle nonspecific: Kill resting as well as dividing cells, e.g. nitrogen mustard, cyclophos phamide, chlorambucil, carmustine, dacarbazine, busulfan, L-asparaginase, cisplatin, procarba zine, actinomycin D.b) Cell cycle specific:Kill only actively dividing cells.

When we are born we are born with a particular telomeric length. As cells get into cell cycle, during replication, the telomeric end is progressively shortened. This happens because for DNA polymerase to replicate a DNA, we need to add RNA primers first. So ends of chromosome are replaced by RNA during replication. This RNA being labile gets lost.* After 50 to 70 cell divisions, the telomeric ends reach a critical or minimum length called as Hayflick limit. Beyond hayflick limit length of telomere, if the cells are allowed to get into cell cycle, the telomere length is not good enough to maintain the stability of chromosomes. The chromosomes accumulate mutation. To avoid accumulation of mutation, once a cell has reached the critical length of telomere, the cells are not allowed to get into cell cycle any more. When the cells are not able to get into cell cycle, the losses are not being replenished and that is when ageing begins.* To avoid this we are provided with a telomerase enzyme. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase. IT has RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity. Based on the RNA fragments left back in the terminals as a result of replication, Telomerase synthesises and replaces DNA fragments. Hence the length of telomeric ends can be maintained and ageing is prevented.* Hence telomerase is an antiageing enzyme.\n\nThe answer is C. Telomerase"}]}

DNA is also present in mitochondria (but less than 0.1% of the total DNA)\" - Harpers 30th/eMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA or or mDNA)oMitochondrial DNA is the only non-chromosomal DNA in human cells. Mitochondrial DNA is only a small portion of the DNA in a eukaryotic cell (less than 0.1% of the total DNA).oIn humans, the 16,569 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA encode for only 37 genes. Human mitochondrial DNA was the first significant part of the human genome to be sequenced.oMitochondrial DNA is almost always maternally inherited. Thus diseases caused by mutation in mitochondrial DNA are always inherited from mother to next generation. All children from affected mother will inherit the disease. But no children will inherit the disease from affected father. Both male and females are affected. Affected son does not transmit the disease to next generation.oMitochondrial vs. Nuclear DNAoSimilar to the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome is built of double-stranded DNA, and it encodes genes. However many interesting features distinguish human mitochondrial DNA from its nuclear counterpart, including the following:oThe mitochondrial genome is circular, whereas the nuclear genome is linear.oThe mitochondrial genome is built of 16,569 DNA base pairs, whereas the nuclear genome is made of 3.3 billion DNA base pairs.oThe mitochondrial genome contains 37 genes that encode 13 proteins, 22 tRNAs, and 2 rRNAs.oThe 13 mitochondrial gene-encoded proteins all instruct cells to produce protein subunits of the enzyme complexes of the oxidative phosphorylation system, which enables mitochondria to act as the powerhouses of our cells.oThe small mitochondrial genome is not able to independently produce all of the proteins needed for functionality; thus, mitochondria rely heavily on imported nuclear gene products.oOne mitochondrion contains dozens of copies of its mitochondrial genome. In addition, each cell contains numerous mitochondria. Therefore, a given cell can contain several thousand copies of its mitochondrial genome, but only one copy of its nuclear genome.oThe mitochondrial genome is not enveloped, and is it not packaged into chromatin.oThe mitochondrial genome contains few, if any, noncoding DNA sequences. (Three percent of the mitochondrial genome is noncoding DNA, whereas 93% of the nuclear genome is noncoding DNA).oSome mitochondrial coding sequences (triplet codons) do not follow the universal codon usage rules when they are translated into proteins.oSome mitochondrial nucleotide bases exhibit functional overlap between two genes; in other words, the same nucleotide can sometimes function as both the last base of one gene and the first base of the next gene.oThe mitochondrial mode of inheritance is strictly maternal, whereas nuclear genomes are inherited equally from both parents. Therefore, mitochondria-associated disease mutations are also always inherited maternally.oMitochondrial genes on both DNA strands are transcribed in a polycistronic manner: Large mitochondrial mRNAs contain the instructions to build many different proteins, which are encoded one after the next along the mRNA. In contrast, nuclear genes are usually transcribed one at a time from their own mRNA.\n\nThe answer is A. 1%"}]}

This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, thus, functions as a tumor suppressor. As such, p53 has been described as \"the guardian of the genome\" because of its role in conserving stability by preventing genome mutation. Hence TP53 is classified as a tumor suppressor gene. (Italics are used to denote the TP53 gene name and distinguish it from the protein it encodes.) The name p53 was given in 1979 describing the apparent molecular mass; SDS-PAGE analysis indicates that it is a 53-kilodalton (kDa) protein. However, the actual mass of the full-length p53 protein (p53a) based on the sum of masses of the amino acid residues is only 43.7 kDa. This difference is due to the high number of proline residues in the protein, which slow its migration on SDS-PAGE, thus making it appear heavier than it actually is. In addition to the full-length protein, the human TP53 gene encodes at least 15 protein isoforms, ranging in size from 3.5 to 43.7 kDa. All these p53 proteins are called the p53 isoforms. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene (>50%) in human cancer, indicating that the TP53 gene plays a crucial role in preventing cancer formation. TP53 gene encodes proteins that bind to DNA and regulate gene expression to prevent mutations in the genome\n\nThe answer is D. All of the above"}]}

The polypeptide later foldsinto an active protein and performs its functions in the cell. The ribosomefacilitates decoding by inducing the binding of complementary tRNA anticodonsequences to mRNA codons. The tRNAs carry specific amino acids that are chained together into a polypeptide as the mRNA passes through and is read by the ribosome. Translation proceeds in three phases: Initiation: The ribosome assembles around the target mRNA. The first tRNA is attached at the sta codon. Elongation: The tRNA transfers an amino acid to the tRNA corresponding to the next codon. The ribosome then moves (translocates) to the next mRNA codon to continue the process, creating an amino acid chain.

Formation of Carbamoyl Phosphate: Condensation of ammonium ion with bicarbonate ion resulting in the formation of carbamoyl phosphate by the help of the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase-I present in the liver mitochondria. It requires Mg2+ and a dicarboxylic acid i.e. N-acetyl glutamate. This step requires 2 ATPs. 2. Synthesis of Citrulline: Carbamoyl phosphate formed in the first step combines with ornithine resulting in the synthesis of citrulline aided by the enzyme citrulline synthase or ornithine transcarbamoylase. Citrulline is easily permeable to the mitochondrial membrane and hence it diffuses into the cytosol. 3. Synthesis of Argininosuccinate: In the cytosol, citrulline combines with the amino acid aspaate forming argininosuccinate catalysed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthase. It requires ATP which is hydrolysed to AMP resulting in utilization of two high energy bonds. Mg2+ acts as cofactor. 4. Cleavage of Argininosuccinate: The enzyme argininosuccinase acts reversibly to cleave argininosuccinate into Arginine and fumarate. Fumarate enters the TCA cycle (the linkage between TCA and urea cycle is known as Krebs bi-cycle). 5. Cleavage of Arginine: Arginine is lysed into ornithine and urea under the influence of the enzyme arginase. Hence arginine is known as semi-essential amino acid i.e. though it is synthesized in the body it is not available for protein synthesis. Ornithine is regenerated in this step and the urea cycle completes by the formation of urea. Ornithine and lysine are potent inhibitors of the enzyme arginase. Arginase is also present in testis, renal tubules, mammary gland and skin in minute quantities. The intermediate amino acids formed in the urea cycle i.e. ornithine, citrulline and argininosuccinate are known as non-protein amino acids. Ref-Sathyanarayana 4/e p370\n\nThe answer is D.

The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult and the person is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can sta at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases sta before the age of 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson&;s disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems. HD is typically inherited from a person&;s parents, with 10% of cases due to a new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual&;s two copies of a gene called Huntingtin. This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The Huntingtin gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called \"huntingtin\". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the Huntingtin protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which can occur at any point in time, regardless of whether or not symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington&;s_disease\n\nThe answer is D.

The transcription of miRNA gene produces primary miRNA transcripts, which is processed in nucleus by a RNAase called Dorsha. Dorsha acts with a nuclear double stranded RNA binding protein called DGCR 8 and converts primary miRNA transcript into pre-miRNA. Pre- miRNA is transported to cytosol by a transport protein (exportin 5). Dicer (cytoplasmic enzyme) does the additional cutting of pre-miRNA to produce mi-RNA duplex, i.e. double stranded miRNA. This double strand unwinds and one strand of this duplex is incorporated into multiprotein complex called RNA induced silencing complex (RCIS), which help in gene regulation.# Base-pairing between the miRNA strand and its target mRNA (messenger RNA) directs RISC to either cause mRNA cleavage or repress its translation. In this way, the gene from which the target was derived is silenced (at a post-transcription level).ii) Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs)# siRNAs work in similar manner as miRNA. Unlike miRNA, siRNA precursors are introduced by investigators into cells.# siRNA are becoming powerful tools for studying gene function and may in the future be used therapeutically to silence specific genes, such as oncogenes, whose products are involved in neoplastic transformation\n\nThe answer is C.

Pa of the molecule resembles the 3&; end of the aminoacylated tRNA. It enters the A site and transfers to the growing chain, causing the formation of a puromycylated nascent chain and premature chain release. The exact mechanism of action is unknown at this time but the 3&; position contains an amide linkage instead of the normal ester linkage of tRNA. That makes the molecule much more resistant to hydrolysis and stops the ribosome.Puromycin is selective for either prokaryotes or eukaryotes.Also of note, puromycin is critical in mRNA display. In this reaction, a puromycin molecule is chemically attached to the end of an mRNA template, which is then translated into protein. The puromycin can then form a covalent link to the growing peptide chain allowing the mRNA to be physically linked to its translational product.Antibodies that recognize puromycylated nascent chains can also be used to purify newly synthesized polypeptides and to visualize the distribution of actively translating ribosomes by immunofluorescence.Ref: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puromycin\n\nThe answer is D.

Sometimes electrostatic attraction between foreign antigen and MHC molecule can cause self antigen damage by immune response generated against foreign antigens.* Molecular mimicry is also possible between two recognized peptides that have similar antigenic surfaces in the absence of primary sequence homology. For example, specific single amino acid residues such as cysteine (creates di-sulfide bonds), arginine or lysine (form multiple hydrogen bonds), could be essential for T cell cross-reactivity.* Immunological tolerance is the ability to discriminate self-antigens from foreign antigens and to not produce antibodies against self-antigens* Loss of this immunological tolerance is generally considered as a initiation factor for autoimmunity* Immunological tolerance is generally established in foetus, soon after the pre-T cells leave the bone marrow and they reach the thymus* In thymus, any clone of T cell which binds only weekly to self-antigen i.e., MHC class I antigen is positively selected and is allowed to undergo maturation.* Any clone which binds avidly to one's own MHC class I molecules are negatively selected and apoptosis is induced. This is called as clonal deletion* For exposure to more antigens, this process is found to continue even in peripheral circulation. The clonal deletion analogue which happens in peripheral circulation is called as clonal anergy* B cell tolerance is mediated by VDJ rearrangements and somatic hypermutation* Failure of these immunological tolerance rules can result in autoimmunity\n\nThe answer is B.
